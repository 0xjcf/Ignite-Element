## Features

- **Plug-and-Play Adapters**: Easily integrate Redux, MobX, or XState with prebuilt adapters.
- **State Management Modes**: Support for shared and isolated state components.
- **Flexible Style Support**: Inject global styles or define custom styles for your components.
- **Modern Templating**: Use `lit-html` for dynamic, efficient templates.
- **Developer Friendly**: A consistent API for managing state across different libraries.

## Quickstart

Hereâ€™s how to set up your first ignite-element project:

Install `ignite-element` with your preferred state management library:

```bash
npm install ignite-element redux @reduxjs/toolkit
```

Or for XState:

```bash
npm install ignite-element xstate
```

### Examples:

- [XState Example](https://github.com/0xjcf/ignite-element/blob/main/src/examples/xstate/README.md): Demonstrates state machine integration using XState.
- [Redux Example](https://github.com/0xjcf/ignite-element/blob/main/src/examples/redux/README.md): Shows how to manage state with Redux.
- [MobX Example](https://github.com/0xjcf/ignite-element/blob/main/src/examples/mobx/README.md): A reactive state management example using MobX.

### Shared vs. Isolated Components

ignite-element offers two approaches to state management for web components

| Feature                | Shared Components                        | Isolated Components                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **State Sharing**      | Shared across all instances              | Independent for each instance                |
| **Use Case**           | Global state like shopping cart or theme | Local state like form inputs                 |
| **Performance Impact** | Updates re-render all shared components  | Updates only re-render the specific instance |

### Initializing ignite-element

Both shared and isolated components require initializing an instance of `igniteElement`. For example:

```typescript
import { igniteCore } from "ignite-element";
import counterMachine from "./stateMachine"; // or Redux store

const igniteElement = igniteCore({
  adapter: "xstate", // Replace with "redux" for Redux
  source: counterMachine, // Replace with Redux store for Redux
});
```

### Shared Components

Shared components share the same state across all instances. This is useful for global states like shopping carts or user session data, where every component reflects the same underlying state.

<b>Example Use Case:</b>: A shopping cart summary that updates across the entire app.

```typescript
igniteElement.shared("cart-summary", (state, send) => {
  return html`
    <div>
      <h3>Cart Summary</h3>
      <p>Total Items: ${state.totalItems}</p>
      <button @click=${() => send({ type: "CLEAR_CART" })}>Clear Cart</button>
    </div>
  `;
});
```

---

### Isolated Components

Isolated components have independent state management. Each component instance operates in its own scope, ensuring no interference with other components.

<b>Example Use Case:</b>: Independent product quantity selectors for an e-commerce site.

```typescript
igniteElement.isolated("product-counter", (state, send) => {
  return html`
    <div>
      <h3>Product Counter</h3>
      <p>Quantity: ${state.quantity}</p>
      <button @click=${() => send({ type: "DECREASE" })}>-</button>
      <button @click=${() => send({ type: "INCREASE" })}>+</button>
    </div>
  `;
});
```

### Styling with ignite-element

**Note:** If using preprocessed styles (e.g., SCSS or Tailwind CSS), ensure the styles are compiled to a distributable `.css` file before referencing it in `styles.paths`. For example, use a build script like:

```bash
sass ./src/styles.scss ./dist/styles.css
```

And add the path

```typescript
const igniteElement = igniteCore({
  adapter: "xstate",
  source: counterMachine,
  styles: {
    paths: ["./dist/styles.css"],
  },
});
```

**Note:** If `styles.paths` and `styles.custom` are not provided, no additional styles will be applied to your components. Ensure you configure at least one of these options to style your components effectively.

**Using the** `styles.custom` **Property**: The styles.custom property allows you to directly inject CSS rules into your ignite-element components. This is particularly useful for small customizations or inline styles that don't require a separate stylesheet.

```typescript
const igniteElement = igniteCore({
  adapter: "xstate",
  source: counterMachine,
  styles: {
    custom: `
      .custom-margin {
        margin-bottom: 3rem;
      }
    `,
  },
});
```

This approach is ideal for dynamically generated styles or when external stylesheets are not necessary. However, for larger stylesheets or frameworks like Tailwind CSS, consider using the styles.paths property to reference your compiled CSS file.

### Best Practices for Styling

- Use `styles.paths` for global stylesheets like Tailwind or SCSS.
- Use `styles.custom` for inline styles shared across multiple components.
- Combine `styles.paths` and `styles.custom` to create reusable, flexible designs.

For an example of using `styles.custom`, see the [MobX example in the repository](https://github.com/0xjcf/ignite-element/blob/main/src/examples/mobx/README.md). This demonstrates how to define and apply custom inline styles effectively.
